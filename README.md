# WineQuality-Prediction

Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains the code for predicting wine quality using six different machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, KNeighbors, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Logistic Regression. The goal of this project is to build models that can accurately predict the quality of wine based on various features.

A] Dataset

The dataset used for this prediction task should be available above. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted, with each row representing a sample of wine and each column containing different features, including the target variable 'quality' that indicates the wine quality to be predicted. You can also download datasets from [kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

B] Machine Learning Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms have been employed for the wine quality prediction task:

1. Decision Tree: A non-parametric supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

2. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

3. Gradient Boosting Classifier: Another ensemble learning technique that builds multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) sequentially, with each one trying to correct the errors of the previous one.

4. KNeighbors: A lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks based on the similarity of input data points.

5. Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space.

5. Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification tasks, where the output is transformed using the logistic function to obtain probabilities.
